            <p class="about">Hi, my names Kyla Schwarzbach, I’m an eighteen year old artist from the Bay Area. I create art to connect with people and as a means of exploring the world around me. Currently, my body of work focuses on familiar themes; I explore the influence of light, experiment with self-portraits, and focus on emotions in portraiture. </p>

                <div class="text">Vin <div class="dropdown"> In this piece I chose to focus on my friend Vivian, and to depict her with bright contrasting colors. Acrylics allowed me to paint layers on the face and hair in close succession without needing to wait too long for each to dry, and I was pleased with this piece because I captured Vivian’s overall inquisitive nature.</div></div>

I used the top of the painting as my palette and decided to leave the wells of paint as they made the composition more balanced and added another area of interest to the piece. </div></div>

                <div class="text">Clement Street<div class="dropdown">In this personal piece, I chose to depict a small market in San Francisco. I painted from a photo I took while I was stopped at the red light; this was one of the most proportionally and technically challenging pieces I’ve done. As I was working with oils, which have a tendency to mix together, I chose to use a distinct color palette with greater contrast, reducing this risk.</div></div>

                <div class="text">Bedroom<div class="dropdown">In this observational piece, I painted my bedroom from a corner on the floor. I chose both bright and soothing colors to evoke a feeling of comfort in the viewer and to invite them into the room. This piece was done in acrylics which allowed me to quickly capture the room in that moment, and I am very pleased with how alive the space feels. </div></div>

            Kyla is a ray of light in the rather dreary post-impressionist era. I've had the great pleasure of working with and mentoring this talent, and can attest to her spirit, vigor and passion. I expect great things from this young lady and am grateful that I have had to opporunity to experience her work in person.
