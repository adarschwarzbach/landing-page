# landing-page
Site demo at: https://adarschwarzbach.github.io/landing-page/

Landing page project inspired by coursework for The Odin Project. All HTML is from scratch, styled with only CSS.the page has been designed with variable broswer window size's in mind. Not yet styled for mobile devices and buttons do not have functionality. If I were to scale this project I would consider lower resolution images / compression to minimize load time.

In the future I hope to create much neater style sheets and re-use more code. 

The page serves as the start to site to showcase my sister's artwork.
